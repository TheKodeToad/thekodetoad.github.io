-- How my breakout game works --
I was a little too lazy to heavily research how the original game worked, so I ended up making things up.
This should help understand how to play, or might simply be interesting. This won't be too detailed, I might as well just publish the code at that point.

-- Leveling --
The only difference between levels is speed. Each level adds .5 pixels per frame to the ball speed, the first level starting at 2px per frame.

-- Physics --
There is no randomness. The ball's direction is decided when hitting the paddle, not even taking into account the previous rotation.

-- Scoring --
Hitting the sides of the screen will award you just 2 points. Some versions punish you for touching the ceiling but I decided not to do this.

Hitting the:
- green blocks (1st and 2nd from bottom) will give you the most at 100 points
- yellow blocks (3rd and 4th from bottom) will give you 50 points
- red blocks (3rd 4th from top) will give you 20 points
- blue blocks (1st and 2nd from top) will give you the least at 10 points

The amount of points is multiplied by the the volley counter (number of blocks hit in between touching the paddle) which stops at 3.
